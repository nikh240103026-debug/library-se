# User Stories – Library Book Management System

## Sprint 1: Book Registration

**US-1:**  
As a librarian,  
I want to add a new book with a unique Book ID, title, and author,  
So that the library can maintain a record of books.

**US-2:**  
As a librarian,  
I want the system to reject duplicate Book IDs,  
So that each book can be uniquely identified.

## Sprint 2: Borrow and Return Book

**US-3:**  
As a user,  
I want to borrow a book if it is available,  
So that I can read it.

**US-4:**  
As a user,  
I want the system to prevent borrowing a book that is already borrowed,  
So that incorrect borrowing does not happen.

**US-5:**  
As a user,  
I want to return a borrowed book,  
So that it becomes available for others.

## Sprint 3: Library Report

**US-6:**  
As a librarian,  
I want to generate a library report showing all books and their status,  
So that I can easily track available and borrowed books.
